## When did you get in into blockchain technology and why do you think it can change the world?

**Robert:** I’ve been interested in the blockchain for a long time, but data breaches at Yahoo, Equifax, and Facebook were the tipping point for me. I knew there had to be a better way to conduct business with a defined level of privacy and security.

I then realized blockchain potential is much higher. It’s not only about the traders, speculators, and economic incentives. The unbanked population of the world has some fantastic things coming their way. The brightest technologists, cryptographers, and distributed computing professionals are focused on solving many more challenging problems. All of this is very motivational for me.

**Travis: **Around 2009 or 2010 I was in a python chat on efnet and accidentally stumbled onto bitcoin when someone working on the original QT wallet wanted to try this new fancy thing called “pair coding”. The technology was finally getting to where it was acceptable so I wanted to give it a shot.

He explained it to me that we were going to work on a wallet for a new “digital currency” called Bitcoin, and not much more than that. I originally thought after working on this for a couple hours, “this is cool, but it’ll never work.” Mostly because I didn’t understand it at the time and hadn’t really learned about it. A couple of years later the price had increased to around $10 and was starting to get into the news. I saw it somewhere and thought, “Hey I worked on that for an evening.” So I sat down and read the Satoshi whitepaper and that’s when I realized it was more than just a digital currency. I really had that “aha” moment.

**Nitin:** I got introduced to blockchain back in the day through Bitcoin. It wasn’t popular at that time, well in India at least and due to the recent advancements made me realize the potential of what Blockchain technology could do to this world. Be it communication, transaction, investments, trading, I believe blockchain technology could touch into each and every aspect of our day to day lives and change the way we consume technology.

## What made you join the MARKET Protocol team?

**Robert:** Shortly before the Denver Global Blockchain Summit in April 2018, I was researching a variety of sectors in the blockchain industry. During the conference, I met with Collins and Phil, and we talked about MARKET, current crypto trading challenges, and the philosophy of orderly markets.

I read the MARKET Protocol [whitepaper](https://marketprotocol.io/assets/MARKET_Protocol-Whitepaper.pdf) before our meeting, and I had a good understanding of what they were trying to accomplish. After the conference, it was clear to me that I wanted to help make the project successful so I jumped in with both feet!

**Travis:** I really enjoyed working with the Market Protocol team after doing some freelance work through [Gitcoin](https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-testimonials-market-protocol-722dbb263d19). I did a pretty big project and thought Phil would be a great person to work with. So when they made an offer I jumped at the opportunity!

I also really liked that the team was doing everything without an ICO. It shows that they’re very serious about the project and that was something I was looking for when transitioning into this space.

**Nitin:** I started freelancing through Gitcoin early on and Eswara introduced me to [MARKET Protocol](https://marketprotocol.io/) when they were creating their brand and needed some design help. Had an opportunity to work on a bunch of stuff related to design and front-end development early on. I always had this general conception that Blockchain companies/startups focus things on the dev side and going ICO quickly and give mere time and efforts to the product, to the usability and the brand. But that conception was changed when MARKET Protocol started evolving, the amount of thought and effort put into creating MARKET and its dApp made me dive straight into its whitepaper and involving more with the project. Eventually, Phil liked my work and offered me a full-time role which I didn’t think twice to agree.

## What makes you the most excited about the future of MARKET Protocol?

**Robert:** It’s hard to predict the future since our industry is moving extremely fast and every week the landscape looks different. What I do know is, to protect the integrity and long-term viability of the crypto markets, derivatives are a vital component of the system. As we all know, the volatility we’re experiencing now doesn’t blend well with orderly markets.

As we move into a more normalized market, you’ll see [MARKET Protocol](https://marketprotocol.io/) at the forefront of the innovation while partnering with other leaders in the distributed exchange market. For example, **the ability to create trading relationships with off and cross-chain assets is a gamer changer. It’s a bit hard to grok right now, but I believe it will become one of those tools that you ask yourself, how did I trade without it?**

**Travis:** The team’s experience and the problem we’re trying to solve. I come from a web 2.0 background, so working on something in the [derivatives](https://medium.com/market-protocol/why-derivatives-cb65de0cd528) trading space is new for me and really exciting.** I think the experience of the founders is perfect for trying to solve decentralized derivatives and they’re assembling a great team to see their goals through. Beyond that, every day is a learning experience.** For a developer working full time on web3 is like a dream come true. Getting paid to learn cutting edge technology. What more is there to be excited for? It’s really fun!

**Nitin:** MARKET Protocol brings the derivatives and trading onto the decentralized exchanges. To do this, the people behind it should have a strong grasp of the current blockchain market along with derivatives and trading which **I have no doubt about the founders and their experience that they could drive this vision for sure. **With a bunch of [partnerships](https://marketprotocol.io/partners) incoming, great contributors to the project and good team to work with, I feel confident and excited about the future of MARKET Protocol.

We welcome our new team members and look forward to working alongside them!
