              <ContentWrapper>
                Users can hedge utility tokens with MARKET Protocol removing
                price movement both up and down. The majority of existing and
                future ICO tokens provide the owner some benefit or utility.
                These tokens, however, may have considerable price volatility
                which could actually outweigh any potential benefit associated
                with the token. MARKET Protocol provides owners of utility
                tokens a way to hedge their price exposure while maintaining the
                utility associated with owning the tokens. Token owners never
                sell or transfer their tokens.
              </ContentWrapper>
              <ContentWrapper>
                In this example, we will use SALT lending tokens. SALT is a peer
                to peer lending platform allowing users to borrow fiat through
                loans backed by crypto holdings. SALT Lending tokens are
                necessary to participate on the platform and obtain loans.
              </ContentWrapper>
              <ContentWrapper>
                Since they were issued, SALT tokens have traded from the low $2s
                to a high of over $17. With MARKET Protocol traders can hedge
                this price volatility.
              </ContentWrapper>
              <ContentWrapper>
                To illustrate this example, suppose Trader A owns a number of

                It is important to note, that Trader A still has his SALT tokens

                without ever touching the original tokens.
