                Decoupling Price from Utility - A Scaling Issue
              </SubHeading>
              <ContentWrapper>
                Price volatility is one factor limiting growth in the blockchain
                space. Holders of crypto assets, ERC20 or otherwise, currently
                have no effective way to manage their price exposure. A
                Bloomberg article entitled “Ethereum’s Volatility is Undermining
                its Viability" 1 mentions an 8% move in the British Pound during
                Brexit as abnormally large and unprecedented. In 2017,
                Ethereum’s standard deviation was ~7.5% compared to ~0.5% in the
                EUR/USD currency pair. Price volatility must be decoupled from
                utility in order for crypto assets to mature as a store of
                value, a medium of exchange or other utility applications.

                  Centralized derivatives exchanges rely on clearing firms to
                  handle customer funds. In 2011, MF Global reported a shortfall
                  in customer accounts as large as $1.2 billion. When MF 2
                  Global declared bankruptcy, approximately 33,000 customers had
                  their funds frozen. 3 Custody of funds and segregation of
                  customer funds are concerns with current exchange models.

                  By design, exchanges obfuscate counterparties and in doing so
                  make it difficult to view the market as a whole. Participants
                  must trust that clearing firms and exchanges are appropriately
                  monitoring trader's positions and capital balances. There is
                  no way to guarantee market solvency.

                Commercial Contracts

                  Exchanges, as for-profit entities, only offer contracts they
                  believe will be commercially successful. They have minimum
                  market participation and open interest goals for new contracts
                  to attract more significant institutional clients. As a
                  result, potentially useful contracts may not get listed,
                  forcing traders and businesses to transact only in contracts
                  the exchanges choose to list.

                Cryptocurrency exchanges are different from derivatives
                exchanges and more closely resemble the US equity markets. Many
                fragmented cryptocurrency exchanges provide a venue for
                participants to engage in discrete transactions like trading
                Bitcoin (“BTC”) for US dollars (“USD”) or Ethereum (“ETH”) for
                other ERC20 tokens.

                Typically, the exchanges charge the user a fee expressed as a
                percentage of the trade or charges for withdrawals or fiat
                currency deposits. The fee can vary depending on the order type.
                Cryptocurrency prices differ from exchange to exchange due to
                the market participants’ perception of each exchange’s capital
                controls, solvency, liquidity, regulatory regime, and other
                factors.

                Given the increasing worldwide user base for cryptocurrency
                exchanges and institutional demand, The Chicago Board Options
                Exchange, The CME Group, and LedgerX began trading BTC options
                and derivatives. However, these projects were built on top of
                traditional exchange and clearing models and will continue to
                perpetuate the problems discussed in prior sections. They also
                require traders to post USD margin.

                  Trades on centralized crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and
                  Kraken do not result in actual transactions on the blockchain;
                  instead, they are internal transactions on the exchange’s
                  ledger. Only when a user withdraws crypto tokens from an
                  exchange to the user’s digital wallet does a blockchain
                  transaction take place, thus giving users control over the
                  tokens. Until that point, funds reside in a commingled
                  exchange wallet leaving trader's funds at risk.

                  Limited products exist and proposed decentralized exchanges
                  limit trading to ERC20 tokens with no ability to trade the
                  majority of other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin,
                  Litecoin or Ripple. Additionally, all trades are A for B,
                  atomic transactions. traders can only trade assets they own.
                  If they want price exposure to multiple crypto assets, they
                  must buy, hold and store each one.

                  Traders have limited options to short crypto assets or bet on
                  a decline in price. Currently, there is no easy way for
                  traders to borrow or sell assets and shorting crypto assets
                  for the average trader is complicated.

                Inefficient Markets

                  Short sellers provide an essential force in the marketplace by
                  allowing speculators and hedgers to bet on a decrease in
                  price. Without short sellers, a fundamental piece of an
                  efficient market is missing. Further, most traders, including
                  U.S. based traders, cannot deploy leverage on crypto assets
                  and are thus forced to post the entire value of their open
                  position resulting in inefficient capital allocations.
